# TextSummarization
Abstractive Text Summarization using Machine learning

This project implements an abstractive text summarization system using machine learning techniques.

Abstract:

Extractive summarization identifies important sentences from the original text to create a summary. This project goes beyond that by employing machine learning to generate a 
concise summary that captures the main ideas while potentially using new phrasings and sentences not found in the original text.

Key Technologies:

Machine Learning: The project will likely utilize a specific machine learning model like a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an encoder-decoder architecture.

Deep Learning Libraries (optional): Libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch might be used to build and train the model.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques: Text preprocessing, tokenization, and other NLP methods will be essential for preparing the text data for the machine learning model.

Project Structure: (Modify based on your specific implementation)

      1. data/: This folder will likely contain the training and testing datasets for the summarization model.
      2. src/: This folder will contain the source code for the project, potentially including subfolders for: 
          2.1 model/: Code for building and training the machine learning model.
          2.2 preprocessing/: Code for cleaning and preparing text data.
          2.3 evaluation/: Code for evaluating the performance of the summarization system.
          2.4 summarization/: Code for the core summarization functionality using the trained model.
      3. requirements.txt: This file will specify the Python libraries required to run the project.

Getting Started:

This section provides instructions on how to set up and run the project.

Prerequisites:

1. Python 3.6 or later (check with python --version in your terminal)

2. A package manager like pip (check with pip --version in your terminal)

Installation:

Step 1.Clone this repository using git:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/abstractive-text-summarization.git

Step 2.Navigate to the project directory:

cd abstractive-text-summarization

Step 3.Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:

1.The project provides a script summarize.py to summarize text from a file or user input.

2.To summarize text from a file:

python summarize.py --input_file path/to/your/file.txt --output_file summary.txt

* Replace path/to/your/file.txt with the actual path to your text file.

* The summarized text will be saved to summary.txt by default. You can specify a different output file with the --output_file option.

3.To summarize text from user input:

python summarize.py --input_text "Your text to be summarized" --output_file summary.txt

* Replace "Your text to be summarized" with the actual text you want to summarize.

Additional Notes:

* You can explore different options by running python summarize.py --help to see all available arguments.

Contribution Guidelines:

* Include guidelines for those who want to contribute to the project, specifying how to submit bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions.
